🧮 3x3 Linear Solver – Numerical Methods Project

This is an interactive web application designed to solve 3x3 systems of linear equations using **Gauss-Jordan Elimination** and **Inverse Matrix Method**. Built using **Tailwind CSS** and **Math.js**, this project was developed as part of a university assignment for the Numerical Methods course.

📊 Project Overview

This project allows users to input a 3x4 augmented matrix and displays both the final solution and the step-by-step calculations using two methods. It’s built with a clean and modern UI using Tailwind utility classes, and all calculations are processed in real time using JavaScript.

🌟 Key Features

- Solve linear systems using Gauss-Jordan & Inverse Matrix
- Step-by-step calculation display
- Responsive and minimalist UI
- Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript
